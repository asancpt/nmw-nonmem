I wish to announce the publication of two tutorials on NONMEM estimation methods in the journal “Translational and Clinical Pharmacology (TCP)”. 
TCP is the official journal of Korean Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (KSCPT) which was founded in 1992. 

- **R-based reproduction of the estimation process hidden behind = NONMEM® Part 1: first-order approximation method (by Prof. K.S. Bae)** 
This introduces how the FO estimation steps are processed in NONMEM using R codes so that readers may experience what is happening in NONMEM running. 
This article is not for daily M&S activities, rather for those who wanna look into the other side of the moon. 

- **Statistical basis for pharmacometrics: maximum likelihood estimator and its asymptotics (by Prof K. Choi)** 
This summarized knowledge pieces needed to understand MLE, which are scattered in stat, linear algebra books and M&S books (Bonate’s and Pinheiro’s… ), for pharmacometricians without stat. background.
